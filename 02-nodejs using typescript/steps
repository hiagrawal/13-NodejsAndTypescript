install ts congif file using 'tsc --init'
install package.json file using 'npm init'

install express using 'npm install --save express'
install body-parser package using 'npm install --save body-parser'

Now when we convert app.js to app.ts, we get error in require but typescript does not understand require and for that we can
install 'npm install --save-dev @types/node'

@type allows typescript translations for javascript code 
using this, we can use nodejs specifoic code in typescript file

to make typescript understand and recognize all express methods
install 'npm install --save-dev @types/express'
This will install type definitions for the express library

now to use es6 import feature, we added '"type":"module"' with javascript but with typescript, we get this as it install
with typescript, we can bydefault use import syntax and we should use import syntax cz as we use that we get suggestions 
and method names available and its overloads paramters 

we should also uncomment "moduleResolution": "node" in tsconfig file so that it understands that it is a node application
