To use typescript, we need to install a compiler that converts typescript to javascript as browser understands only javascript

for that we need to install
-npm install -g typescript

Once typescript is installed, we can run 
tsc <filename- ts file> (on git bash) or tsc.cmd <filename- ts file> (on powershell)
so it converts ts file into js file into a new generated file

so we created app.ts file and run tsc app.ts and it generated app.js file that we included in index.html page

to check if typescript is installed, 
tsc -v /tsc.cmd -v

defer makes sure that it executes only when the html body has been parsed
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
