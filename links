To use typescript, we need to install a compiler that converts typescript to javascript as browser understands only javascript

for that we need to install
-npm install -g typescript

Once typescript is installed, we can run 
tsc <filename- ts file> (on git bash) or tsc.cmd <filename- ts file> (on powershell)
so it converts ts file into js file into a new generated file

so we created app.ts file and run tsc app.ts and it generated app.js file that we included in index.html page

to check if typescript is installed, 
tsc -v /tsc.cmd -v

defer makes sure that it executes only when the html body has been parsed
<script src="app.js" defer></script>

Now, when we didnt use 'type', we were able to pass numbers as strings also but now when we defined the type number 
and run tsc app.ts to convert it to js, it gave us an error that argumnet of type string is not assignable to type number
and that's the basic usage of typescript that it allows us to avoid errors at compile time or during development only that
we might get during runtime with javascript
